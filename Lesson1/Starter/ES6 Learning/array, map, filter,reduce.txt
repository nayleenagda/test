Arrays

In Es6 for arrays we write it like this. 

This is how we copy data from one array to another

	const array1= [3,4,5,6]
	
	//Empty Array
	const array2 = []
	
	//For Each array, multiply the elements by 2
	
	const new array = array1.foreach ((num) => {
		array2.push(num*2);
	})
	
	console.log(array2);
	

There is an easier way to do this.





Map

Use it for pure simple looping and always has a return. Stores the variable in a 
separate array =mapArray 
whilst in for each u need to create a brand new array. the stuff u return out is what makes
up the array

const mapArray= array.map((num)=>{
	return num*2;
})


console.log('map', mapArray)


u can simplify it look like this, cos it only has one parameter

const mapArray= array.map(num => return num*2);

	


Filter

Filter it goes through the array and makes a new array if it passes through the filter
If it passes through the filter, then it copies that into the filterArray


const filterArray = array.filter (num => return num >5);

or 

const filterArray = array.filter (num=>{
		return 2>5
})




Reduce	

powerful method. The 0 is the default accumulator. It can be changed and it alters the 
first number. In this case it does 0+ all the numbers in the array


const reduceArray = array.reduce ((accumulator,num)=>{
		return accumulator + num
}, 0)
