Currying


Accepts only one parameter at at time

So instead of function Add (a,b){}... We are doing function Add (a)... and then inside it we will have B


		function curriedMultiply (a){
	
			return function (b){
				return a*b;
			};


		};
		
		
If we write in Es6 format, it is:

	function curriedMultiply =(a)=> (b) => a*b;
	
	

And you call it

curriedMultiply (3)(4);

Importance:


* If we want to multiply the value by 5, instead of having to keep change the function, you just write


	var multiplyBy5= curriedMultiply(5)


so u write... 
	
	
	multiplyBy5(11)
	
		This means 5*11 55
	
	or multiplyBy5(5)
	
		This means 5*5 =25
