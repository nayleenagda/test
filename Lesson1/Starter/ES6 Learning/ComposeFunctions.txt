Compose

Output of one function is the input of another function

	constant compose = (f,g)=> (a)=> f(g(a))

	const sum= (num)=> num+1;

	compose (sum,sum)(5);
	

This means

	constant compose = (f,g)=> (a)=> f(g(a))
	
	constant compose = (f,g)=> (a)=> f(g(5))
	
	= 6

Then

	constant compose = (f,g)=> (a)=> f(6))
	
= 7

Answer is 7!
